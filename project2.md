## Project description

This arcade style Sudoku game was built using Java. It contains three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. The player is tasked with completing puzzles within a certain time. If they succeed they will be prompted to enter their initials into the highscores leaderboard. More puzzles can be added to the desired "difficulties" file, inside the Sudoku Gameboards folder.

## How to run the program

Clone the repository and open the folder in your desired Java IDE. Ensure that you have your desired JDK loaded in the project. Select the Main.Java file and press the "Run" button in the IDE.

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
