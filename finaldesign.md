## Project description

This assignment was to create three different posters to advertise an event at CSU. The illustrations were to contain illustrations designed in our style and a type script for each design.

## Design

I decided to create event posters for an Outdoor Club at CSU. I have a great love for the outdoors, especially when the time spent outdoors involves offroading, hunting or exploring. I wanted to capture this in the different designs for the event. Promoting time for hiking, hunting and going offroading as group activities for the club.

The first illustration is to capture the beauty of wheelin' through Moab.

The second illustration is to capture the full experience of overlanding to a remote location and camping in the great outdoors.

The third illustration is to capture the different activities the club organizes: offroading, hiking and hunting. I wanted to create an illustration to serve as a logo for the club, promoting their activities for those who came across the poster's location.
